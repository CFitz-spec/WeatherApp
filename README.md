This is an application that shows the weather
Live onRender.com

https://weatherapp-o097.onrender.com




Currently:

The user can find out the weather of any major city that they search.
The App will show the current weather and change the asthetics of the app accordingly.



What I would like to add is:
The ability to change what units the weather is shown in. // Finished!
The forcast for the next five days

To do the next five day forecast I would need to create a component for the weather part
Send the correct data as props to each comp
Add a scrollable div that allows users to scroll down and see the weather for the next five days
